TEMPORAL PROGRAMMING IN TESSERACT
==================================

Tesseract introduces a revolutionary approach to programming with its built-in temporal 
programming capabilities. Unlike traditional programming languages where variables only 
hold their current value, Tesseract allows variables to maintain a complete history of 
their past values. This enables developers to create time-aware applications that can 
analyze trends, detect patterns, and make decisions based on historical data without 
requiring external databases or complex data structures.

Temporal programming is particularly valuable for applications involving sensor data, 
financial analysis, system monitoring, and any scenario where understanding how values 
change over time is crucial for decision-making.

TEMPORAL VARIABLES
==================

Temporal variables are the foundation of time-aware programming in Tesseract. When you 
declare a temporal variable, you specify how many historical values it should remember. 
This creates a sliding window of data that automatically manages memory and provides 
instant access to past values.

Declaration:
    let$ var := <temp@N>  # N is the history size

The history size determines how many previous values the variable will remember. For 
example, <temp@5> will remember the current value plus the 4 most recent previous values.

Assignment and History Management:
    let$ x := <temp@3>     # Create temporal variable with history of 3
    let$ x := 10           # First assignment: x@0 = 10
    let$ x := 20           # Second assignment: x@0 = 20, x@1 = 10
    let$ x := 30           # Third assignment: x@0 = 30, x@1 = 20, x@2 = 10

Each time you assign a new value to a temporal variable, the previous values shift down 
in the history chain. The oldest value beyond the specified history size is automatically 
discarded, ensuring efficient memory usage.

Accessing Historical Values:
    x@0  # current value (30) - most recent assignment
    x@1  # previous value (20) - one step back in time
    x@2  # value before that (10) - two steps back in time

The @ operator followed by an index number allows you to access any value in the 
variable's history. Index 0 always represents the current value, while higher indices 
represent progressively older values.

TEMPORAL LOOPS
==============

Temporal loops provide an elegant way to iterate through a variable's entire history 
without manually accessing each index. This is particularly useful when you need to 
process all historical values or search for specific patterns across time.

The temporal loop automatically iterates from the most recent value (index 0) to the 
oldest available value in the history:

    temporal$ t in x {
        ::print "Historical value: @s" (t)
    }
    # Output:
    # Historical value: 30  (current value)
    # Historical value: 20  (previous value)
    # Historical value: 10  (oldest value)

This loop structure is more efficient than manually iterating through indices and 
automatically handles variables with different history sizes. It's commonly used for 
calculating aggregates, searching for specific values, or applying transformations 
to historical data.

BUILT-IN TEMPORAL FUNCTIONS
===========================

Tesseract provides a comprehensive suite of built-in functions specifically designed 
for temporal data analysis. These functions eliminate the need for manual loops and 
complex calculations when working with historical data.

Temporal Aggregation
--------------------

::temporal_aggregate(variable_name, operation, window_size)

This powerful function performs mathematical aggregations over a sliding window of 
historical values. It's essential for calculating moving averages, finding extremes 
in recent data, or summarizing trends over specific time periods. The sliding window 
approach means you can focus on the most relevant recent data while ignoring older, 
potentially less relevant information.

Parameters:
- variable_name: String name of the temporal variable (must be quoted)
- operation: Mathematical operation - "sum", "avg", "min", "max"
- window_size: Number of most recent historical values to include in calculation

Examples:
    let$sensor := <temp@10>
    let$sensor := 100
    let$sensor := 105
    let$sensor := 110

    # Calculate average of last 3 values
    ::print ::temporal_aggregate("sensor", "avg", 3)  # prints 105

    # Sum of last 2 values
    ::print ::temporal_aggregate("sensor", "sum", 2)  # prints 215

    # Min/Max operations
    ::print ::temporal_aggregate("sensor", "min", 3)  # prints 100
    ::print ::temporal_aggregate("sensor", "max", 3)  # prints 110

Temporal Pattern Detection
--------------------------

::temporal_pattern(variable_name, pattern_type, threshold)

Pattern detection is crucial for understanding the behavior of time-series data. This 
function uses sophisticated algorithms to automatically identify common patterns that 
would be difficult to detect manually. It's particularly valuable for monitoring 
systems, financial analysis, and predictive maintenance applications.

Parameters:
- variable_name: String name of the temporal variable (must be quoted)
- pattern_type: Type of pattern to detect - "trend", "cycle", "anomaly"
- threshold: Sensitivity threshold - lower values are more sensitive to changes

Pattern Types Explained:
- "trend": Analyzes the overall direction of data movement. Returns 1 for upward 
  trends (values generally increasing), -1 for downward trends (values decreasing), 
  and 0 for stable periods (no clear direction).
- "cycle": Identifies repeating patterns in the data, useful for detecting seasonal 
  variations or periodic behavior in systems.
- "anomaly": Uses statistical z-score analysis to identify values that deviate 
  significantly from the historical norm, helping detect outliers or system failures.

Examples:
    let$sensor := <temp@10>
    let$sensor := 100
    let$sensor := 105
    let$sensor := 110

    # Detect upward trend (threshold 3%)
    ::print ::temporal_pattern("sensor", "trend", 3.0)  # prints 1 (upward)

    # Detect anomalies (z-score threshold 2.0)
    ::print ::temporal_pattern("sensor", "anomaly", 2.0)  # prints 0 (no anomaly)

    # Add anomalous value and test again
    let$sensor := 200
    ::print ::temporal_pattern("sensor", "anomaly", 1.5)  # prints 1 (anomaly detected)

Temporal Condition Checking
---------------------------

::temporal_condition(variable_name, condition, start_index, window_size)

Checks if a specific condition is met within a temporal window.

Parameters:
- variable_name: String name of the temporal variable
- condition: Condition string (">", "<", "==", "between", "increasing", "stable")
- start_index: Starting position in history (0 = current, 1 = previous, etc.)
- window_size: Number of consecutive values to check

Examples:
    let$temp := <temp@20>
    let$temp := 95
    let$temp := 98
    let$temp := 102
    let$temp := 105

    # Check if last 3 values were all above 100
    ::print ::temporal_condition("temp", "> 100", 0, 3)  # prints false

    # Check if values 2-4 steps back were all below 100
    ::print ::temporal_condition("temp", "< 100", 2, 3)  # prints true

    # Check if any value in last 5 was exactly 98
    ::print ::temporal_condition("temp", "== 98", 0, 5)  # prints true

    # Check if all values in window are between 90-110
    ::print ::temporal_condition("temp", "between 90 110", 0, 4)  # prints true

    # Check if values are increasing for 3 consecutive steps
    ::print ::temporal_condition("temp", "increasing", 0, 3)  # prints true

    # Check if variance is low (stable period)
    ::print ::temporal_condition("temp", "stable 5", 0, 4)  # prints 1 (variance < 5)

USE CASES
=========

Temporal programming in Tesseract opens up numerous practical applications across 
various domains. Here are some real-world scenarios where temporal capabilities 
prove invaluable:

Temporal Condition Monitoring:

System monitoring applications benefit greatly from temporal programming. Instead of 
just checking current values, you can analyze trends and patterns to predict failures 
before they occur. This proactive approach is essential for maintaining system 
reliability and preventing downtime.
    let$ pressure := <temp@50>

    # Monitor if pressure stayed in safe range for last 10 readings
    func$ pressure_safe() => {
        ::temporal_condition("pressure", "between 10 50", 0, 10)
    }

    # Check if there's been consistent increase (trend detection)
    func$ pressure_rising() => {
        ::temporal_condition("pressure", "increasing", 0, 5)
    }

    # Alert system based on temporal conditions
    if$ not ::temporal_condition("pressure", "< 60", 0, 3) {
        ::print "WARNING: High pressure detected!"
    }

Moving Averages:

Financial and statistical applications often require moving averages to smooth out 
short-term fluctuations and identify underlying trends. Temporal variables make 
this calculation straightforward and efficient.
    let$ price := <temp@5>
    let$ price := 100
    let$ price := 105
    let$ price := 98

    func$ moving_average() => {
        let$ sum := 0
        let$ count := 0
        temporal$ p in price {
            let$ sum := sum + p
            let$ count := count + 1
        }
        sum / count
    }

State Tracking:

Many applications need to track state changes over time. Temporal variables provide 
an elegant solution for detecting transitions, measuring state durations, and 
analyzing state patterns.
    let$ state := <temp@10>
    let$ state := "idle"
    let$ state := "processing"
    let$ state := "complete"

    # Check if state changed
    if$ state@0 != state@1 {
        ::print "State changed from @s to @s" (state@1, state@0)
    }

Time Series Analysis:

Complex time series analysis becomes manageable with temporal programming. You can 
implement sophisticated algorithms for trend detection, forecasting, and pattern 
recognition directly within the language.
    let$ sensor := <temp@100>

    func$ detect_trend() => {
        let$ increasing := 0
        let$ decreasing := 0
        
        loop$i := 0 => 4 {
            if$ sensor@i > sensor@(i+1) {
                let$ increasing := increasing + 1
            } else {
                let$ decreasing := decreasing + 1
            }
        }
        
        increasing > decreasing ? "upward" : "downward"
    }

MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=================

Tesseract's temporal programming system is designed with efficiency in mind. The 
language automatically handles all aspects of memory management for temporal variables, 
ensuring optimal performance without requiring manual intervention from developers.

Key Memory Management Features:
- History is automatically managed by the runtime system
- Oldest values are automatically discarded when the history limit is reached
- Memory usage is O(N) where N is the specified history size
- No memory leaks or fragmentation issues with temporal data
- Efficient circular buffer implementation for optimal performance

This automatic management means developers can focus on application logic rather than 
worrying about memory allocation, deallocation, or optimization of historical data storage.

BEST PRACTICES
==============

To maximize the effectiveness of temporal programming in Tesseract, follow these 
established best practices developed through extensive real-world usage:

1. Choose Appropriate History Size: 
   Carefully balance memory usage with the depth of history you actually need. A 
   larger history size consumes more memory but provides richer historical context. 
   Consider your application's requirements - sensor monitoring might need hundreds 
   of values, while simple state tracking might only need 3-5.

2. Initialize Before Use: 
   Always assign initial values to temporal variables before attempting to access 
   their history. Uninitialized temporal variables may contain undefined values 
   that can lead to unpredictable behavior.

3. Check Bounds Carefully: 
   Accessing x@N where N exceeds the available history returns undefined behavior. 
   Always ensure your index values are within the valid range (0 to history_size-1).

4. Use Temporal Loops When Possible: 
   Temporal loops are more efficient than manual history iteration and automatically 
   handle boundary conditions. They're also more readable and less error-prone than 
   manual index management.

5. Consider Performance Implications: 
   While temporal operations are optimized, excessive use of large history sizes 
   or frequent temporal function calls in tight loops may impact performance. 
   Profile your application when working with large datasets.

    func$ is_stable() => {
        let$ stable := true
        loop$i := 0 => 2 {
            if$ value@i != value@(i+1) {
                let$ stable := false
            }
        }
